## Education History
I am a researcher and an software engineer, worked in the security industry for a while, and did some project, but still, I am a learner first.

I completed my Higher Secondary School (12th Grade) from <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.A.V._College_Managing_Committee">DAV Public School</a>, Faridabad, Haryana, India; in 2018 and then started my Undergraduate college in the same year.

I did my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from <a class="link" href="https://vitbhopal.ac.in/">Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) University</a>, India [Bhopal Campus]. Here I got familiarized with academic and industrial research by my amazing profs.

Since the start of my undergrad, I've been particularly curious about cyber security, computer networks and computers. Even though I was not able to put my hands on some of these topics then, Currently, I am trying to explore them.
