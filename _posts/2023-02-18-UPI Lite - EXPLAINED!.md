### Introduction

A new payment option called UPI LITE makes use of the dependable NPCI Common Library (CL) application to process low-value transactions with a set value of less than 200. In order to guarantee system acceptance, and compliance, the solution uses mobile-specific UPI ecosystem protocols. The UPI LITE experience is intended to be a user-friendly method for facilitating low-value transactions without utilizing the core banking systems of a Remitter bank in real time and to adequately mitigate risk.

### FAQs

**Who can use UPI Lite?**

According to an NPCI press release, the BHIM app now supports the UPI Lite feature. The BHIM app is currently available to eight banks' UPI Lite customers. According to the NPCI, these financial institutions include Canara Bank, HDFC Bank, Indian Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India Union Bank of India, and Utkarsh Small Finance Bank.

### Benefits

In the P2PM category, UPI Lite is an excellent option for making payments at local stores.

The majority of transactions are under Rs. 200. In addition, unless you like to keep track of where you spend your money, the user does not have to see hundreds of entries on the bank account statement. There are only a few online industries in which the majority of transactions are less than Rs. 200. A few examples: Gaming, mobile recharge, and quick commerce (to some extent) are all supported by UPI Lite at this time (P2M).

Upon completion, UPI Lite will address a number of SRT, scalability, and availability issues.
