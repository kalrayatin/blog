<div class="message">(Password and Toothbrush : A Myth?)</div>

Password and Toothbrush has a very unique relationship as they both should be changed after the particular time frame and shouldn’t be shared among anyone. One could undoubtedly contend that passwords are rapidly becoming out of date, notwithstanding, we actually use them to get to our applications, messages, online stores, and so on. Since they are still near, we should keep on capitalizing on them to further develop our framework security. Secret phrase security is ostensibly a decent spot to begin with great network safety practice.

### Most people use a word in their passwords in various forms:
* A word — Password
* A word followed by some numbers or symbol— Password.
* A word with ‘leet speak’ applied — P4ssw0rd
* Multiple words placed together — howsecureisthispass

## Common phrases attack

This is where the programmer utilizes phrases that are generally connected with you and could include: birthday dates or that of family/companions, kin's and companions' names, your last name by birth, where you live or have resided, pet's name and so on.

**Dictionary attack**
This is where a PC utilizes a word list, ordinarily from the English word reference to attempt to track down a secret key that works. On the off chance that the normal English-talking grown-up knows somewhere close to 12,000 and 30,000 words, envision how simple it could be for a PC to limit to these words and in a negligible measure of time?

**Hybrid attack**
This is more or a less a high level word reference assault where the PC adds a few numbers and unique characters to the word list.

Clearly, '#qwerty123' is a simple secret key to break.

**Brute force attack**
A savage power assault includes robotized speculating of a critical number of passwords until it tracks down a match. It in this way makes no supposition when contrasted with the word reference assault and half and half assault.

## Improve your Password
**Make solid passwords**
Longer passwords with a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers and exceptional characters are better as it will take a successive device longer to go through the cycles.

Master tip: Use an expression in your **first language**.
**Use multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
Consider MFA a characteristic expansion of having a strong secret word control. It's successful in taking off assaults particularly savage power cyberattacks. At the point when MFA is empowered, regardless of whether an assailant effectively takes your secret key, they will not have the option to get to your record
**Fun Fact - A password may contain blank spaces — anywhere except the beginning or the end.**
### Conclusion
**It is the end of Password Era and beginning of Passphrase**
